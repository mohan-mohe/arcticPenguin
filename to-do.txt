this one looks good
mostra cms 3.0.4

Now figure out the way to the root

- first number of ports which are gonna be open ->

- 80 -> has our vulnerable application installed here
		mostra cms 3.0.4
- 22 -> standard ssh connection 
- 21 -> has some information about the password and with a rabbit hole a zip file

OK first test a new within the tryhackme and then deploy our own creative box
